## 🔐 Trust Service Criteria (TSC)

| Criteria             | Status        | Details |
|----------------------|---------------|---------|
| Security             | ✅ Implemented | Zero-trust routing, cognitive firewall, OWASP scan engine |
| Availability         | ✅ Implemented | Predictive scaling engine, multi-cloud support |
| Processing Integrity | 🟡 Partial     | Memory mesh log replay active; agent verification in progress |
| Confidentiality      | ✅ Implemented | Role-based access control (RBAC), field-level encryption |
| Privacy              | 🟡 Partial     | GDPR/CCPA tags in place; auto-export and consent modules in backlog |

## 📊 Control Implementations

### 🔐 Access Control

- Role-based permissions with scoped tokens (`JWT`)
- CLI and UI auth handled via API gateway session guard
- Admin dashboard user isolation enforced in DX Core

### 🧠 Audit Logging

- All system actions (generation, test, healing) are stored in `mesh_memory.json`
- Immutable time-series format with tag-based filtering
- ReplayExplain module provides auditable justifications

### 🧬 Change Management

- All auto-generated or modified routes are stored and timestamped
- Agent decisions require cognitive firewall approval with confidence scoring
- Version locking for marketplace APIs and public routes

### 📤 Data Export & Portability

- Memory mesh export to `.json` or `.ndjson`
- Export of audit logs, test traces, and replay sessions
- Data deletion pipeline (TTL tag sweep) scheduled for Q3 2025

## 🧪 Planned Audits

| Audit Type       | Vendor         | Target Date |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Internal OWASP   | Self-Audit     | Q1 2025 ✅ |
| Penetration Test | Synack/Bugcrowd | Q2 2025 🔜 |
| SOC 2 Type I     | Vanta          | Q4 2025 🎯 |

## 🧭 Status Summary

CerebroMesh is currently **in-flight** toward SOC 2 Type I certification. Security and availability standards have been met. Audit controls and memory logging are in place. Privacy pipelines and full change-control evidence systems are targeted for Q3–Q4 2025.
