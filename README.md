# 🧠 CerebroMesh

CerebroMesh is a **self-evolving, memory-driven API engine** that generates, scales, heals, and explains APIs using a cognitive architecture inspired by swarm intelligence, reinforcement learning, and semantic memory.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ **Autogenesis Engine** — Instantly creates FastAPI routes from prompts or schemas
- 🧬 **Memory Mesh** — Logs every action, allowing time-travel debugging and replay
- 🧠 **Swarm Testing Agents** — RL-powered agents simulate API chaos to ensure reliability
- 🔐 **Cognitive Firewall** — Validates all actions for safety using semantic rules
- 📈 **Predictive Scaling** — Forecasts traffic and auto-recommends resource scaling
- 💰 **Monetization Layer** — APIs can be published, priced, and sold via Stripe integration
- ♻️ **Energy-Aware Optimizer** — Chooses green cloud regions based on carbon intensity
- 📦 **Marketplace & Composer** — Bundle intelligent APIs and sell/share them
- 🧾 **Compliance Intelligence** — Tag PII fields, validate against GDPR/SOC2/OWASP
