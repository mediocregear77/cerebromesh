# 📚 CerebroMesh API Reference

This reference outlines the autogenerated API endpoints, schemas, and expected behavior. All endpoints follow RESTful conventions and may include AI-enhanced behavior such as self-healing, memory logging, or swarm-based testing.

---

## 🔄 Global Behavior

- 🧠 **Autogenesis**: All endpoints are generated from user intent or schema using the Autogenesis Engine.
- 📈 **Memory Mesh**: Requests and responses are logged to an event mesh for replay and reflection.
- 🛡️ **Cognitive Firewall**: Actions are validated for safety before execution.
- 🔬 **Swarm Testing**: Routes are continuously tested using RL agents in simulated environments.
